A function that takes an array of characters from a pointer 'x' of size 'n' and decrypts it using a substitution cipher, with key 'k'

The substitution key should be formatted such that k is an array of 27 characters, starting with a #, the position corresponding to the letter that each element in x should be replaced with
eg if the third element of k is e, then every b (2nd letter) should be replaced by e

assumes the substition key is all upper case
